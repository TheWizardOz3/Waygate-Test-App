# Build Task

Implement task **[TASK NUMBER]** for the feature **[FEATURE NAME]**: **[TASK DESCRIPTION]**

1. Read `docs/Features/[feature-name].md`
2. Implement the feature. Follow existing patterns in the codebase and keep changes minimal and focused.
3. Run linting after implementation. Don't worry about unit tests for now, those will come as part of a bigger testing step for the overall feature later.
4. Confirm when complete or if blockers arise. Use explicit confirmation like "Task complete. Ready for next task, or do you want to test this first?".

Start with step 1.
