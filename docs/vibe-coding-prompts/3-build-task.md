# Build Task

Implement task **[TASK NUMBER]** for the feature **[FEATURE NAME]**: **[TASK DESCRIPTION]**

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Run linting after implementation
- Confirm when complete or if blockers arise.  Use explicit confirmation like "Task complete. Ready for next task, or do you want to test this first?".
