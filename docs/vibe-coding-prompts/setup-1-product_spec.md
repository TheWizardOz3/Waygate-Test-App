# Plan Product Spec

Build out the product specification from the initial concept:

1. Read `docs/(ignore) brainstorm.md` to understand the original vision and context
2. Read the current `docs/product_spec.md` (may be a template or partial)
3. Identify gaps, assumptions, and areas needing clarification
4. Ask me clarifying questions about:
   - Target users and their specific pain points
   - Feature priorities and MVP scope
   - Success metrics and acceptance criteria
   - Any constraints (technical, timeline, budget)
5. After I answer, expand and update `docs/product_spec.md` with:
   - Detailed feature specifications
   - User flows and acceptance criteria
   - Milestone definitions
   - Explicit scope boundaries (what's NOT included)

Start with step 1. Ask questions before making changes.
