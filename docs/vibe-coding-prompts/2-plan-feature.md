# Plan Feature

Plan the **[FEATURE NAME]** feature:

1. Read `docs/project_status.md` and `docs/product_spec.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
2. Break into atomic implementation tasks (~30-60 min each)
4. Create a feature doc in `docs/Features/[feature-name].md` outlining the feature and the implementation tasks.
5. Update `docs/project_status.md` to mark this feature as in-progress

Start with step 1.
