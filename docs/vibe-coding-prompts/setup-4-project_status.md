# Plan Project Status

Set up the project status tracker:

1. Read `docs/product_spec.md` to understand features and milestones
2. Read `docs/architecture.md` to understand technical scope
3. Read the current `docs/project_status.md` (may be a template or partial)
4. Ask me clarifying questions about:
   - Current progress (what's already done, if anything)
   - Known blockers or risks
   - Timeline expectations
   - Priority adjustments from the spec
5. After I answer, update `docs/project_status.md` with:
   - Current milestone scope (in/out of scope)
   - Feature list with dependencies and complexity estimates
   - Prioritized work queue
   - Future milestone summaries
   - Known issues and tech debt sections (even if empty)

Start with step 1. Ask questions before making changes.
