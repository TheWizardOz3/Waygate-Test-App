# Plan Architecture

Build out the technical architecture from the product spec:

1. Read `docs/(ignore) brainstorm.md` for original technical context
2. Read `docs/product_spec.md` to understand requirements and features
3. Read the current `docs/architecture.md` (may be a template or partial)
4. Identify technical decisions that need input and ask me about:
   - Tech stack preferences or constraints
   - Scale expectations and performance requirements
   - Integration points and third-party services
   - Security and compliance requirements
   - Team expertise and maintenance considerations
5. After I answer, expand and update `docs/architecture.md` with:
   - System architecture diagram/description
   - Data models and database schema
   - API design and endpoints
   - Technology stack with rationale
   - Security considerations
   - Infrastructure and deployment approach

Start with step 1. Ask questions before making changes.
