# Test

Test the **[FEATURE/COMPONENT]** we just built:

1. Read `docs/Features/[feature-name].md`
2. Identify what tests should exist (unit, integration, e2e)
3. Run existing tests to verify nothing broke
4. Write new tests for the new functionality
5. Use browser tools to manually verify UI if applicable
6. Report results

Start with step 1.
